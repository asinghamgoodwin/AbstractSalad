# Abstract Salad Factory

## Development

Abstract Salad Factory has a SQLite and Flask backend and a React frontend. JavaScript is built using webpack.

The first time you clone this repo, you need to install the required node packages. Run `npm install` in the root directory (after installing `npm` if you don't have Node/npm installed already).

To run ASF locally while working, start the Flask and webpack servers like this:

```
python views.py
npm run watch
```
